## Movies Card Library

This was a project developed in the [Software Development Course at Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/formacao-desenvolvimento-web) as a challenge while I was learning how to use the basic of React. In this project I was able to create Components and manipulate them. Made on ```July 22nd, 2021```
